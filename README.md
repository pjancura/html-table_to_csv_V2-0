This Python program takes an input of a .txt file and outputs a .csv.

The contents of the .txt file should an HTML <table></table>.  
In order for the program to work correctly, the first bit of text in 
the .txt file should be "<table>", "<td>", or "<tr>" for examples.

The program does have some ability to account for NULL type values by looking for "<td></td>" patterns.
